					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Follow the Money: Tajikistan’s Payment Reform Channels Wealth to Presidential Family</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">The Tajik government has turned its sights on the remittance market—an economic lifeline for the country. The total amount of money sent home by labor migrants rivals the size of the national budget, so the recent disruption in remittance services has caused serious hardship for tens of thousands of families. Alim Sherzamonov, deputy chairman of the opposition National Alliance of Tajikistan (NAT), explains how the reform could benefit President Rahmon’s son-in-law. <br> <br>

					On December 3, nearly all international money transfer systems in Tajikistan were paralyzed. Across the country, people queued outside banks unable to collect remittances. Numerous news outlets reported that the newly created processing center under the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) had yet to finalize agreements with major Russian remittance providers—including the most widely used, Zolotaya Korona ("Golden Crown"), through which around $2 billion was transferred from January to September, representing approximately 80% of total remittances. <br> <br>

					The severity of the crisis prompted an emergency televised address by Jamoliddin Nuraliyev, deputy head of the NBT—and President Rahmon’s son-in-law. Nuraliyev claimed the goal of the new NBT processing center was to ensure the safety and transparency of citizens' money transfers, and to combat money laundering. As justification, he cited the collapse of payment systems such as Migom and Leader, which allegedly caused Tajik financial institutions to lose $1 million and 45 million rubles, respectively. <br> <br>

					However, this explanation has raised eyebrows, as no such risks were publicly discussed prior to the launch of the NBT processing center. Critics argue that the reform appears less about financial security and more about consolidating control—and profit—within the ruling family’s inner circle.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title title">The President’s Son-in-Law’s Business</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">It is worth noting that this is far from the first business venture of the president’s relative. For example, in 2010, a private company called IRS (Innovative Road Solutions), registered in the British Virgin Islands, became the owner of Tajikistan’s first toll road connecting Dushanbe by the only land route to Sughd Region—the country’s main industrial area. Although the road was built entirely with the state budget and external borrowing, IRS was exempted not only from repaying the loan but also from paying taxes. During the parliamentary discussion of the bill granting this tax exemption, the speaker inquired about the company’s ownership, but despite deputies receiving no clear answer, the law was passed. Journalists and independent investigators later proved that the company’s owner is indeed Nuraliyev. <br> <br>

					Among his other significant assets is the Tajik-registered joint-stock company Spitamen Bank.

					Jamoliddin Nuraliyev is the husband of 41-year-old Ozoda, Rahmon’s eldest daughter, who heads the presidential administration. They married in 2005, and shortly after, Nuraliyev went to study in the United States at the University of Maryland. This marked the start of his meteoric career. It is worth noting that he is the only member of Rahmon’s family—and almost the only government official—who actually holds a relevant education and is a competent specialist in his field. Almost every move he makes, unlike other family members, brings the highest profits with long-term prospects. <br> <br>

					Most likely, even analysts and observers do not yet fully grasp Nuraliyev’s plans for this processing center project. While not an expert in banking and finance, I will venture a few assumptions based on my experience studying the structure of Rahmon’s “family business” in Tajikistan.

					So what are Nuraliyev and his father-in-law hoping to achieve by undertaking this “financial hub” project?</p>

					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">From Every Migrant Worker, a Little Bit</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Starting from the Smallest — Commission Fees on Money Transfers
					The National Bank of Tajikistan’s (NBT) share in the total volume of remittances from migrant workers in Russia may be around 0.5%. If in 2019 the total volume was $2.5 billion for the first nine months, then NBT could earn at least $12–15 million per year. With currency conversion, this amount could grow significantly. <br> <br>
					Back in April 2015, prompted by Nuraliyev, NBT shut down about three thousand currency exchange points under the pretext of "ensuring the stability of the domestic currency market." Since 2015, almost the entire currency exchange market in the country has been under Nuraliyev’s control — which did not help stabilize the national currency exchange rate. At that time, the dollar was worth 5.3 somoni; today, according to the official NBT rate, the dollar buying rate is 9.68 — nearly double. However, no bank sells dollars at this official rate. Small businesses, relying on imports from China and other countries, buy dollars on the black market where the price is at least 5% higher than the official rate. The lion’s share of the profit from this difference goes to the "family." <br> <br>

					Now let's calculate how much can be earned from the money transfer market this way. Even before December 2, Tajik banks issued foreign currency remittances (in rubles and dollars) to recipients exclusively in somoni, converted at the official rate. Five percent of $2.5 billion equals $125 million. And this is only the dollars of migrant workers; the overall currency turnover is much larger. Tajik businessmen importing goods also need to buy foreign currency. They mostly do so not from migrant remittances, but from credit sources and NBT reserves — reportedly involving sums of another $1–2 billion. Thus, Nuraliyev could be making up to $200 million a year just from currency conversion. <br> <br>
					So, what did the "family" lack under the existing system? Since the volume of remittances remains stable, what additional profit will Nuraliyev gain from this new processing center if he already effectively controls all transaction volumes?</p>
					
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Nuraliyev alone can earn up to $200 million annually just from currency conversion</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Perhaps Nuraliyev’s ambitious goal is to create a unified financial system that, on one hand, is highly technological and fully online, and on the other hand, completely controlled—one that would not depend on the plans of major external players like “Zolotaya Korona.” When the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) announced in October the creation of a processing center with strict requirements for service providers, it was clear from Tajik experience that agreements with one or two providers had already been reached, so only one or two payment systems—most likely not the most popular ones—would remain on the market. When the scandal erupted on December 3, two players declared they were operating normally and would not stop service: “Unistream” and “Kontakt.” The first is a well-known Russian bank with a developed branch network and a recognized payment system. As for “Kontakt,” although it has been on the market since 1999, few Tajiks have heard of it, and its points of service are 4–5 times fewer than those of “Zolotaya Korona.” It can be assumed that “Unistream” will mainly handle money transfers outside the CIS, while “Kontakt” will become the sole provider for transfers from Russia to Tajikistan. <br> <br>

					From the beginning, it was clear that major payment systems would not agree to NBT’s condition to open accounts in this bank—at least due to possible conflicts with Russian laws regarding this point. However, Nuraliyev took this step and likely chose the lesser-known “Kontakt” as a temporary partner precisely because it posed fewer risks to his online project. If Nuraliyev’s plan succeeds, classic money transfers to Tajikistan will become a thing of the past in less than a year. Consumers, sitting on their couches, will be able to send any amount in just minutes, and “Spitamen Bank” will become something like “Tinkoff,” which would be a huge achievement for Tajikistan. <br> <br>

					Moreover, the payment system will help Tajik banks. In the early years, Tajik migrants, sometimes risking their lives, carried cash with them. Then banks started functioning, and payment systems appeared. Migrants began to trust these banks, and their families gradually got used to keeping their savings there. Later, Russia experienced a currency crisis in 2014, which severely affected Tajikistan’s banking system. After two of the largest Tajik banks went bankrupt and failed to return deposits to their clients, trust in banks was seriously shaken. First, people had much less free money to save, and second, there was no reason to trust the banks. Therefore, the creation of the processing center is also a measure to save Tajikistan’s banking system, since the NBT requires payment systems to place temporary deposits as collateral. <br> <br>

					But strategically, it is better for Nuraliyev and his family if the major players leave the market. His main goal is total control over all foreign currency inflows and the entire money supply in Tajikistan. It can be assumed that soon anyone wanting to receive a transfer even within the country will have to obtain the so-called national payment card “Korti Milli”—all transactions will go through this card, which will be linked to the NBT processing center.</p>
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Nuraliyev’s main goal is total control over all foreign currency inflows and the entire money supply in Tajikistan.</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Next, as they say, various scenarios are possible: ranging from problems with cashing out to the necessity of explaining the origin of the money and the purposes of its receipt. And most importantly — of course, not all citizens will immediately withdraw all the money from their cards. They will save it for a rainy day, for weddings, to start their own business, to buy real estate, and so on. These savings for long-term and prospective goals will increase liquid banking capital, without which it is impossible to obtain international loans. Control over this capital will significantly increase Nuraliyev’s influence and his weight compared to other domestic players — such as the uncle of his wife, Hasan Asadullozoda, who so far may not even suspect the far-reaching plans of his relative. By taking control of such a huge interest-free loan, Nuraliyev will practically replace the national bank himself, and his “Spitamen Bank” will determine the interest rates for the banks that remain in this market. <br> <br>

					But artificial capitalization is not yet a recipe for saving Tajikistan’s economy. It is not enough to gather 2–3 billion in deposits; it is also necessary to ensure the turnover of this capital and receive dividends from it — that is, production of something must be established, and to produce, one will need to think about sales. It is clear that the NBT’s processing center itself will neither increase the purchasing power of our citizens nor the competitiveness of Tajik goods on the global market. Therefore, most likely, the assets of Rahmon’s family will grow on their offshore accounts.</p>
