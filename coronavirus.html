					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Coronavirus? What coronavirus? How Tajikistan is trying to ignore the growing epidemic.</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">According to official data, not a single case of coronavirus has been reported in Tajikistan. However, 1,836 people who recently arrived from abroad are currently in quarantine. Unlike most of the world, the country continues to function almost as normal. Navruz was recently celebrated on a grand scale, the Tajikistan football championship is ongoing, and only on the eve of April 18 did authorities in Dushanbe cancel public festivities for City Day — an event of special significance this year, as the mayor of the capital, Rustam Emomali (the son of President Rahmon), had just been elected speaker of the upper house of parliament, officially becoming the country’s second-highest-ranking official.

					Alim Sherzamonov, deputy chairman of the opposition National Alliance of Tajikistan, explains why the country’s authorities are ignoring the coronavirus, how they are manipulating statistics, and how the epidemic could devastate the national economy.</h2>
					
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Manipulation of diagnoses</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">The first reports of a possible coronavirus infection in Tajikistan appeared in the media on April 5. Radio Ozodi, citing a source in the healthcare sector, reported that “the Tajik authorities placed the central hospital in the Jabbor Rasulov district in the north of the country under quarantine after the death of a 60-year-old patient, and that 11 doctors and other medical staff were suspected of having the coronavirus.” All of the infected individuals were transferred to the infectious diseases hospital in the city of Khujand. The condition of the chief physician of the quarantined hospital was described as “critical.”
					The man whose death triggered the hospital lockdown was named Habibullo Shodiev. According to official sources, he died of pneumonia on April 1.
					On April 11, following contact with his brother Abdujalil Shodiev, Khojimuhammad Toshev was hospitalized and placed on a ventilator. Official reports claimed the reason was coronary heart disease and stage-two hypertension. <br> <br>
					There were also fatalities reported in other regions. On April 11, a memorial service was held in the Shahristan district of Sughd Province for Shodmon Rajabov, who had died the day before. According to the regional health department, he did not die of the coronavirus, but from complications following a “contrast sauna.” In the official version, after undergoing this water treatment, Rajabov was diagnosed with tuberculosis and died within a day, despite being placed on a ventilator.
					Maruf Khojiboev, deputy head of the Sughd regional health department, said that Rajabov’s family members were quarantined and “are under medical supervision.” <br> <br>

					On the evening of April 12, in the south of the country, 58-year-old Oishamokh Alimova — a staff member at the central district hospital in Bokhtar — also died while on a ventilator. This is the same facility where 400 Tajik citizens recently returned from Russia are being quarantined. The official cause of her death was reported as infiltrative tuberculosis of the middle portion of both lungs and left ventricular hypertrophy. <br> <br>
					The Ministry of Health continues to reassure the population, stating that no coronavirus infections have been registered in Tajikistan and that none of these fatalities are connected to COVID-19. According to ministry spokesman Darveshzoda, “no one is interested in hiding such information if it were to occur, and the Ministry will inform citizens immediately upon detection of the first COVID-19 case.”</p>
					
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">The Epidemic That Isn’t</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Meanwhile, in neighboring Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, hundreds of infections have already been officially confirmed. The authorities there acknowledged the threat of an epidemic and, as early as late March, implemented a series of strict containment measures — including, of course, the cancellation of all public events. <br> <br>

					Against this backdrop, Tajikistan appears as a striking — if not outright reckless — exception: Navruz was celebrated with pomp, national football league matches continue to take place, and mass festivities for Dushanbe City Day on April 18 remained scheduled until the very last moment.</p>
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Compared to its neighbors, Tajikistan stands out as a striking — if not criminally negligent — example of complacency in the face of an epidemic.</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Globally, there are three main approaches to managing the pandemic: strict lockdowns, including military mobilization (as in China); a combination of relatively tight quarantine measures, public messaging promoting self-isolation, and government-backed economic support (as seen in the U.S. and much of Europe); and finally, minimal restrictions relying on the strength of the healthcare system and citizens’ sense of responsibility (like Sweden). <br> <br>
					Then there’s Belarus, which follows a separate path altogether. As President Lukashenko himself admitted, he simply cannot afford a lockdown. (For more on Belarus’s response, see: “We’re collapsing under the pressure — the chief doctor is carrying oxygen tanks himself”: Belarusian doctors on the real scale of the epidemic.) Lukashenko is willing to sacrifice the elderly, but not the economy. <br> <br>
					While Tajikistan’s situation may resemble that of Belarus on the surface, there are critical differences. First, Tajikistan’s economy depends heavily on remittances from migrant workers. That means the length of the quarantine in Russia — not Tajikistan — is the country’s main concern. Everyone is hoping that cross-border transportation resumes as soon as possible. <br> <br>

					Second, implementing a lockdown within Tajikistan is technically and logistically extremely difficult. The country has some of the slowest and most expensive internet in the world, making any shift to online work or services virtually impossible. Even in the capital, cashless payment isn’t always an option for basic necessities — the internet is too slow, and many shops still lack working point-of-sale systems. Closing all city bazaars is practically unthinkable, and in rural areas, people can’t survive without mutual support and informal exchange.</p>

					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Tajikistan has some of the slowest and most expensive internet in the world, making it virtually impossible to move any activity online.</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Another reason for the government's refusal to acknowledge the threat of coronavirus lies in President Rahmon’s political agenda. On April 17, as planned by the president, his son Rustam Emomali was elected speaker of the upper house of parliament, officially becoming the second-highest-ranking official in the country. Now, in the event of Rahmon’s early departure from office, Emomali would automatically assume the presidency. This was effectively the coronation of the heir to the Rahmon dynasty — and nothing was supposed to overshadow it. <br> <br>
					Preparations for mass celebrations in Dushanbe on April 18 were in full swing, with authorities hoping until the last moment that the epidemic wouldn’t derail their plans. The difficult decision to cancel the festivities was made only on the evening of April 16 — just one day before Rustam Emomali’s formal appointment as the official successor. <br> <br>
					It’s possible that Rahmon was influenced by his conversation with Vladimir Putin about the pandemic, which reportedly took place on April 15 at Rahmon’s own initiative. One way or another, in his speech before both chambers of parliament, the president publicly mentioned the coronavirus for the first time. <br> <br>

					Now, it is likely he will portray himself as perhaps the only leader on the planet who succeeded in protecting his people from the virus — while, in typical fashion, accusing his opponents of spreading panic in an attempt to destabilize the country.</p>

					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Monetizing the Disaster.</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Sooner or later, the authorities will probably have to announce the detection of the first coronavirus cases in the country. After all, denial of the epidemic paradoxically coexists with President Rahmon’s continuous requests for international support in the fight against coronavirus — a special aid fund has even been established for this purpose. It seems likely that the Tajik government has two different reports on the coronavirus situation: one for domestic use and another for international donors via diplomatic channels. Rahmon could be an excellent fundraiser, as it is a special skill to publicly declare a complete victory over the coronavirus while simultaneously convincing donors of the urgent need to help the country combat an epidemic that threatens, among other things, an economic catastrophe. <br> <br>
					The economic problems linked to the halt in remittances from migrant workers will be severe. Not only do most migrants currently have no work opportunities, but their prospects for the future are bleak: the global economic crisis and the drop in oil prices are hitting Tajik migrant workers even harder than the Russians themselves. This is because Tajik migrants in Russia mostly work in small and medium-sized businesses, which are currently the hardest hit. Employers, despite their willingness to keep their staff, often simply cannot afford to do so — it is quite possible that many of them will soon be looking for jobs themselves. <br> <br>
					Already, many Tajik citizens are either completely unemployed or unable to obtain the new permits required to go to work, even if their employers need their services. Many of them already struggle to pay for housing and food, and if the quarantine lasts three months or longer, the migrant crisis will escalate into a humanitarian catastrophe both in Russia and Tajikistan. From the official actions of Dushanbe, it is not apparent that the authorities fully grasp the seriousness of the situation or are trying to take measures to reduce the risks.</p>
