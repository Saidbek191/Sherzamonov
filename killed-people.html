					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Tajikistan After 25 Years of Rahmon: Corruption and Control</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Emomali Rahmon Ranks Fifth Among the World’s Longest-Serving Leaders, Surpassed Only by Four African Heads of State

					On November 6, it marked 25 years since Emomali Rahmon was first elected president of Tajikistan. He now ranks as the fifth longest-ruling political leader in the world, trailing only four African counterparts. Alim Sherzamonov, deputy chairman of the National Alliance of Tajikistan and a political analyst, explains how the dictator’s brother-in-law became the country’s top oligarch, why many Tajiks consider Afghanistan to be more developed, and how Rahmon is attempting to overcome international isolation.

					November 6 is a significant date in the history of sovereign Tajikistan. Exactly 25 years ago, in 1994, Emomali Rahmon was elected president and the country’s constitution was adopted. The government had long prepared for this anniversary as a major national celebration. However, plans had to change — after considerable effort from the entire state apparatus, Rahmon’s long-delayed European tour was finally arranged. Over the past five years, Tajikistan’s president had remained largely grounded, with the exception of frequent trips to China and neighboring countries. As a result, the planned festivities were postponed while Rahmon and his delegation embarked on a European tour.

					Rahmon’s full official title is “Founder of Peace and National Unity — Leader of the Nation.” His rise to power did bring an end to the bloody civil war, but the decades of his rule have failed to bring prosperity to Tajikistan. Among all former Soviet republics, the country consistently ranks at the bottom in most socio-economic indicators. Even neighboring Afghanistan — a country ravaged by nearly continuous war — is often seen by Tajiks as more appealing, especially in terms of political and civil liberties.</p>
				<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Even War-Torn Afghanistan Seems More Appealing to Tajiks</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">One of the most notable events marking the anniversary was the so-called presidential "Golden Amnesty": according to government claims, it will in some way affect 20,000 individuals. The amnesty provides for the release of all women, minors, and persons over the age of 55. However, political opponents convicted on fabricated charges were notably excluded from Rahmon’s gesture of mercy — despite their advanced age and deteriorating health.

					Those left behind bars include 69-year-old journalist Hikmatullo Saifullozoda, the leader of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan, Mahmadruzi Iskandarov (age 65), opposition figures Zubaidullo Rozik (73), Rahmatullo Rajab, Mahmadali Hayit, and many other dissidents over the age of 60.</p>
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">An Economy Built for the Loyal Few</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">In addition to political pressure on the opposition and restrictions on freedom of speech and religion, economic pressure is also widely used in Tajikistan against competitors of Rahmon’s family, including corporate raiding. Companies owned by the president’s relatives are regularly exempted from paying taxes under various pretexts, giving them a clear competitive advantage. <br> <br>
					In Tajikistan, few are surprised anymore that Rahmon’s closest relatives use state loans to purchase goods, construct facilities for their private businesses, and avoid taxes and duties. Just recently, Hasan Asadullozoda — Rahmon’s brother-in-law and owner of one of the country’s largest banks, the aluminum plant, and Tajikistan’s biggest airline “Somon Air” — purchased the first Eurocopter off the assembly line in Kazakhstan. According to some reports, Kazakhstan plans to sell Somon Air another 5–6 Eurocopters, developed in partnership with Airbus, and is prepared to offer Tajikistan a loan for the purchase. Even by the most conservative estimates, the cost of a single helicopter exceeds €3 million. <br> <br>

					Due to their compact size, these aircraft are primarily intended for private use and are not suitable for commercial aviation, meaning they cannot be considered a public investment. Nevertheless, the purchase was exempted from customs duties and VAT, and it is highly likely that their continued operation will be funded by the state budget of Tajikistan. <br> <br>
					Companies owned by individuals within Rahmon’s inner circle — such as IRS, TALCO, Faroz, and Somon Air — regularly benefit from such privileges. At times, in order to grant them tax exemptions, the government submits proposals to the Legislative Assembly for approval. Typically, lawmakers approve these decisions blindly, without knowing who owns the companies or even what goods are involved.</p>
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Tajikistan’s external debt continues to grow.</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">At the same time, Tajikistan’s external debt—according to even official figures—is approaching $3 billion and is expected to surpass that mark by the end of the year. The government itself has admitted that the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached a critical high of 40%. Independent experts estimate this figure to already exceed 50%. Today, every citizen of Tajikistan—including infants and the elderly—effectively owes $154 to foreign creditors. All signs suggest that this debt will continue to grow exponentially. The government forecasts an annual increase in external debt of just over $200 million, and even this prediction appears overly optimistic, as it becomes increasingly difficult to find funds to service the debt. The 2020 national budget allocated around $200 million specifically for debt servicing. <br> <br>

					What raises the most concern today is the fact that Tajikistan’s primary creditor is China’s Exim Bank, which now holds over 51% of the country’s total external debt. It is widely understood that, unlike Western lenders, the Chinese do not forgive debts. Instead, they have already begun reclaiming natural resources as repayment. In September, Tajikistan’s parliament officially transferred legal ownership of the country’s largest silver deposit in the Gorno-Badakhshan region to a Chinese company, which had already begun extraction operations there two years earlier. Previously, Tajikistan handed over the “Upper Kumarg” gold deposit in the north of the country to China as part of a deal to pay off debts incurred for the modernization of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power plant. Under that agreement, the Chinese will continue extracting gold until Tajikistan’s debt is fully repaid. Notably, it is the Chinese side that determines the accounting prices, which makes it unclear how—either in the near or medium term—Tajikistan will be able to repay its debts to China and other creditors. <br> <br>

					The country's main economic lifeline remains labor migration. In 2018, Tajikistan’s total exports of goods and services amounted to $939 million, while labor migrants sent home around $2.6 billion—against a national GDP of $7.5 billion. The peak of remittance inflows from Russia occurred in 2014 (before the ruble’s collapse), when migrant workers transferred a total of $4.1 billion back home—1.5 times more than the national budget at the time. According to the latest statistics, despite the growing number of migrant workers leaving the country, the volume of remittances dropped by over 5% in the first half of 2019, totaling just over $1.1 billion, and is projected to reach no more than $2 billion for the full year.</p>
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">In 2014, the total amount of remittances sent by Tajik labor migrants exceeded the national budget by 1.5 times</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">According to last year’s results, the Tajik government proudly reported economic growth of 7.1% and a 7.3% increase in GDP. While these figures are about 2% higher than IMF expert estimates, even taking them at face value leaves little room for optimism. The key is understanding the baseline: the state of the economy in the late 1990s was so dire that any return to normalcy naturally resulted in relatively high growth rates. Nevertheless, Tajikistan still lags behind even Kyrgyzstan. Although the country managed to surpass Kyrgyzstan in total GDP following the devastation of the 1990s, it continues to fall far behind in terms of GDP per capita. On other indicators—such as the trade balance, budget income-to-expenditure ratio, poverty reduction, and income growth—Tajikistan unfortunately remains in the red.</p>
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">In effect, Rahmon’s state has become one vast financial pyramid and a black hole for international loans and grants</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Tajikistan ranks among the top ten countries in the world in terms of tax burden. The government’s tax collection targets are overfulfilled every year, and those targets keep increasing. As a result, a massive number of small and medium-sized enterprises have been forced to shut down: in the past year alone, 260,000 out of 553,100 registered businesses ceased operations. Of these, 209,000 were individual entrepreneurs operating under a patent, 43,000 held business licenses, and 7,500 were dehkan (family-run) farms. This illustrates a pattern in which new businesses are launched, only to collapse under the weight of unfair competition, excessive taxes, and growing debt to banks. They are replaced by new, inexperienced, and overly optimistic entrepreneurs. This cycle repeats year after year, forcing the country’s most active workforce to close their businesses and join the ranks of labor migrants. <br> <br>

					In effect, Rahmon’s regime has turned the state into a giant financial pyramid and a black hole for international loans and grants. This has also led to a very high level of non-performing loans. By the end of 2018, overdue loans had reached over 8 billion somoni (approximately $210 million). One of Tajikistan’s largest banks, Vnesheconombank, has been unable to return deposits to its clients. Even the president was forced to publicly comment on the situation, citing unpaid consumer loans as the primary reason. In doing so, Rahmon effectively admitted the failure of his own claims about poverty reduction in Tajikistan.</p>
					<h2 class="blog-post__title title">Illusion of democracy</h2>
					<p class="blog-post__text text">Against this backdrop, Rahmon’s aforementioned “European tour” appears to serve mostly symbolic purposes. The political opposition—now entirely in exile—has long pointed to his international isolation, largely caused by systematic repression of dissent and severe restrictions on civil liberties. With presidential elections scheduled for 2020, the regime is determined to stage them on its own terms. Ahead of the vote, Rahmon seeks to present himself as a recognized “democratic leader,” and this trip, orchestrated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, partly serves that goal. <br> <br>

					However, the real state of affairs in Tajikistan is no secret to the leaders of the free world, who are fully aware that nothing has changed. Reportedly, European embassies in Dushanbe were under significant pressure to help facilitate the visits. As a result, a set of meaningless memorandums was signed with Switzerland, and France is expected to follow. Regardless, the primary objective has been met: the opposition’s claims of Rahmon’s diplomatic isolation have been formally—if superficially—disputed. Now, the regime has something to showcase throughout the pre-election year.</p>
